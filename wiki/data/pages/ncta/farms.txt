About 9 days after the announcement, [[business:apollos_bakery|Apollo's Bakery]] sues [[ncta:start|New Caledonia Transportation Agency]] for reparations because it hurt Apollo’s Bakery’s sells if everyone can get food for free. Alan (CEO and Creator of the Community Farms) did not mean to hurt anyone’s sells. He planted the seeds in survival to make matters worse. Alan was trying to fill some of the weird spots in between the plots. Trees didn’t work because they cover the lights. Flowers are useless and do not look good. One of the judges asked, “why do you have farms everywhere if we are replicate a city in Minecraft?” Referring to the previous information. “In real life we have little farms everywhere. On the roof tops of buildings, in your room, even on the windowsill. In Minecraft you simply don’t have the space,” replied Alan Saucer, Creator of the community farms. Other food based businesses also started to step in. The other thing about the community farms is that it only work if everyone helped and did their part. 

===== The Court Ruling =====

All the judges decide that each person that wanted to use it had to pay one time fee of 6 emeralds (as of now its 6 credits) and it would be redistributed among the food businesses.

===== Afterward =====

Community farms are still legal. Players can use them an one time low fee of 6 credits. Some of the have been destroyed and others have been unused. These was not the success that Alan had plan. Now it more of decoration than of actual use. A few months later after the court ruling, Alan inherited Mr. Bacon Brewing Company which is an eatery and potion making business.
