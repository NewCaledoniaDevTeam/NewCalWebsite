Protection from those who think they rule us.

===== About =====
Welcome to New Caledonia's APIC, or the Anti Parental Involvement Coalition. Its president is Councilman Alex Snyder, and is funded by [[business:nct:start|NCT Corporation.]] The APIC Mission Statement is the following: Protection from those who think they rule us. APIC has legislation backing via Councilman Snyder. He is responsible for the Parental Act and Parental Act II. The APIC has financial backing through Councilman Snyder's [[business:nct:start|NCT Corporation]]. Legally, we can sue anyone who goes against us, and we have the full legal power of [[business:nct:freedom_fighters|Freedom Fighters]] at our disposal. Just know, this is a fully legal organization whose purpose is to end the tyrannical backing of parents who, when we are done, will have zero legal power.
