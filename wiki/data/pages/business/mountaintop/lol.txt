===== About =====
Alan is a freelance Minecraft Logo Designer, with 1/2 year of experience.

Alan is a 17-year old, a Minecraft Server owner. Alan has worked in New Caledonia since May of 2020. Alan had created many logos for the server, so Alan thought it should become a business. Alan has two packages for logos. Package one is just a simple logo for one credit. Package two is where you get all the files in all the social media sites. I will also create a video ad. If you get package two you also get customer support. If you have a question please just message Alan.

Alan posted the ad on his YouTube Channel, [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMvOGeh3OZDLG-FljVsGM2w|Weird.exe]].

LoL, LLC is also the company that adds all logos into the New Caledonia Minecraft Server. Alan don't care if you chooses someone else's logo or not. Alan adds free of charge, for now.
