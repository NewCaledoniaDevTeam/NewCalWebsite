===== New Caledonia Shader =====

===== New Caledonia Offical Website Description =====

==== Background ====

Clarksville, Tn. -  Alan started to work on making a shader pack for New Caledonia because the amazing screenshots he took were in Minecraft: Java Edition. After the 1.16 update, new buildings were made of new materials. As a result, Alan thought it would be a great idea to make a shader that works in Bedrock so he can take awesome pictures. Also then he doesn't have to convert from Bedrock to Java. Alan took many open-source Minecraft packs and compiled them into one pack with heavy customization. Alan is still working on it so it in "Beta". Beta means it works though but still a work in process. He has released all of his versions however he forgot to make a changelog. Use the old version at your own risk. To download please go to [[http://download.newcaledonia.ml|Old download page]] or [[https://github.com/NewCaledoniaDevTeam/BETA_UniversalShaderPack/releases|Beta GitHub Releases]]

He has also made a "lite" version. Normally it has dark UI but lite is light UI and smaller size. The logo and background are in black and white to show a difference. The glass is reverted due to popular demand. Alan also doesn't care if you use the shader on anything else or reverse engineer it.

==== Impact ====

So far Alan has four people testing it right now and needs more people. All people have been saying positive things. This will change your Minecraft experience forever.
